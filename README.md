BattleShip is a client-serverGame we had to develop for my third year in engineering school at l'École des Mines d'Alès.

For now, you can:
  - Run the server
  - Open two tabs in a web browser
  - Play battleship with a friend

### Tutorial

 - Enter your username
 - Place your boats using the keyboard (arrows and enter)
 - The first player will start shooting using his mouse. Green means boat, Red is missed, Blue means the boad is sunk

### Installation

BattleShip is running on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

Download the latest version of BattleShip.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd Client-Server_EMA_071116
$ npm install
$ node index.js
```

We still have much to do. Here's a small list:
#### Todos

- Multiplayer mode:
-Allow many couples of players to play simultanously
