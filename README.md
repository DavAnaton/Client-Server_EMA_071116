BattleShip is a client-serverGame we had to develop for my third year in engineering school at l'École des Mines d'Alès.

For now, you can:
  - Run the server
  - Open two tabs in a web browser
  - Play battleship with a friend


### Installation

BattleShip is running on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

Download the latest version of BattleShip.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd Client-Server_EMA_071116
$ npm install
$ node index.js
```
